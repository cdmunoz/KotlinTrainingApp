# KotlinTrainingApp

A simple app in Kotlin to show a general behavior: a main screen with a list of images, then after tapping on an image a new 
screen is shown with the detail, in this case, the image in a larger size. 

This app is a base example to a basic Kotlin training in Vancouver (Vancouver's First Kotlin Night ) to show how easy an 
Android app could be implemented using Kotlin.
